# Shortest Paths With Must-Visit Point

## Problem statement

- How many lattice paths start at S and end at D and pass through P?

## Solution

The solution is all shortest paths from S to P and from P to D.

## Examples

- The number of shortest paths from (0, 0) to (5, 5) and pass through (2, 2) = C(4, 2) + C(6, 3) = 6 + 20 = 26
