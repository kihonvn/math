# Shortest Paths From One Point To Another

## Problem statement

- How many lattice paths can be formed starting at S and ending at E?
- How many lattice paths start at S and end at E?

## Solution

The number of shortest paths from one point to another is C(n, k) where n is the length of the latice and k is the number of steps to the right (or left).

## Examples

- The number of shortest paths from (0, 0) to (5, 5) is C(10, 5) = 252.
