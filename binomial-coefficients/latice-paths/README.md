# Lattice Paths

## Definition

A lattice path is one of the shortest possible paths connecting two points on the lattice, moving only horizontally or vertically (occasionally, right or up).

## Notes

This maze path problem is somehow similar to a counting problem. Let the start S = (n, m), the end D = (c, d), n <= c, and m <= d, P(c-n+d-m, c-n) is the number of ways to go from S to D.
