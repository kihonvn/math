# Recurrence Relation On A Sequence of Numbers 𝑆

## Definition

Let 𝑆 be a sequence of numbers. A recurrence relation on 𝑆 is the formula that relates all but a finite number of terms of 𝑆 to previous terms of 𝑆. Terms whose values are constant are initial conditions. The values of initial conditions complete the definition of 𝑆.

## Examples

- 𝑇(𝑘) = 𝟸𝑇(𝑘-𝟷)<sup>𝟸</sup> - 𝑘𝑇(𝑘-𝟹) with 𝑇(𝟶) = 1, 𝑇(𝟷) = 2, and 𝑇(𝟸) = 𝟹
- 𝑆(𝑘) = 𝑆(⌊𝑥/𝟸⌋) + 𝟻 with 𝑆(𝟶) = 𝟶
