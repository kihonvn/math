# Polynomial Expressions

## Definitions

### Recursive version

Let 𝑆 be a set of coefficients and 𝑥 is a variable.
- A zeroth degree polynomial expression in 𝑥 over 𝑆 is a nonzero element of 𝑆.
- For 𝑛 ≥ 𝟷, an 𝑛<sup>𝑡ℎ</sup> degree polynomial expression in 𝑥 over 𝑆 is an expression of the form 𝑝(𝑥)𝑥 + 𝑎 where 𝑝(𝑥) is an (𝑛-𝟷)<sup>𝑠𝑡</sup> degree polynomial expression in 𝑥 over 𝑆.
