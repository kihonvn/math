# Closed-Form Expressions

## Definition

Let 洧냦 = 洧냦(洧논<sub>洧링</sub>, 洧논<sub>洧맂</sub>, ..., 洧논<sub>洧녵</sub>) be an algebraic expression involving 洧논<sub>洧링</sub>, 洧논<sub>洧맂</sub>, ..., 洧논<sub>洧녵</sub> which are allowed to take on values from some predetermined set. 洧냦 is a closed-form expression if there exists a number 洧녢 such that the evaluation of 洧냦 with any allowed values of the variables will take no more than 洧녢 operations.

## Examples

- 洧녵(洧녵+洧링)/洧맂 is the closed-form expression of 洧냦(洧녵) = 洧녡洧녹洧녴(洧녲, (洧녲, 洧링, 洧녵)) with 洧녢 = 洧맃.
