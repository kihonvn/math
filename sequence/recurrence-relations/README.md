# Recurrence Relation of A Sequence of Numbers

## Definition

A recurrence relation of a sequence of numbers is an equation that could help us to determine any term based on previous ones and the initial conditions (aka., the basis). In a recurrence relation, the number of previous terms decides its order. 

## Examples

- 𝑎<sub>𝑛</sub> = 𝟸𝑎<sub>𝑛-𝟷</sub> 
- 𝑎<sub>𝑛</sub> = 𝟸𝑎<sub>𝑛-𝟷</sub> - 𝑎<sub>𝑛-𝟸</sub>
- 𝑎<sub>𝑛</sub> = 𝟸𝑎<sub>𝑛-𝟷</sub> - 𝑎<sub>𝑛-𝟸</sub> + 𝟸
