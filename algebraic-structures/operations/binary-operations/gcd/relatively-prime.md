# Relatively Prime Pairs

## Definition

An integer pair a and b is relatively prime if gcd(a, b) = 1.

### Examples

- 2 and 3
- 2 and 15
- 3 and 4
- 3 and 10
- 10 and 21

## Theorem

If p is a prime and a is any integer such that p âˆ¤ a, then a and p are relative prime, i.e., gcd(a, p) = 1.

### Examples

- 2 and 3
- 2 and 15
- 3 and 4
- 3 and 10
