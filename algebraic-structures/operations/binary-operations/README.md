# Binary Operations

## Definition

A binary operation is a function from S×S into S where S is a nonemty set.

## Notation

If * is a binary operation on S and a,b ∈ S, there are three common ways of denoting the image of (a,b) over S as the following:

- prefix form: *ab
- infix form: a*b
- postfix form: ab*
