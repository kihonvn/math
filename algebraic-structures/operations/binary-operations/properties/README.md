   1. M defined by aMb = larger of a and b on the positive integers
   1. m defined by amb = smaller of a and b on the positive integers
   1. @ defined by a@b = a<sup>b</sup> on the positive integers
   1. w defined by awb = b on the positive integers
   1. ∗ defined on the integers by a∗b = a+b-2
   1. ⋄ defined by a ⋄ b = ab/2
   1. intersection on the subset of {1, 2, 3, 4}
   1. concatenation on the set of all strings of zeros and ones
