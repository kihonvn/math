# Inverse Property Of Binary Operations

## Definition

A binary operation * on a set S has the inverse property if and only if for each a ∈ S, there exists b ∈ S such that a*b = b*a = e, where e ∈ S such that a*e = e*a = a. In this case, b is an inverse of a.

*It means a binary operation must have identity property to have inverse property if any.*

### Examples

- On ℚ, 1/2 is an inverse of 2, where e = 1.
