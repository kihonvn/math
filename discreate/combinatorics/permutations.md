# Permutations

## Definition

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of taking &#x1D458; from &#x1D45B; different objects (&#x1D7F6; <= &#x1D458; <= &#x1D45B;) such that in it, no object appears more than one.

We use &#x1D4AB;(&#x1D45B;, &#x1D458;) to denote the total number of permutations of taking &#x1D458; from &#x1D45B; different objects.

## Theorem

### Permutation Counting Formula

&#x1D4AB;(&#x1D45B;, &#x1D458;) = &#x1D45B;! / (&#x1D45B; - &#x1D458;)!

## Practices

1. If having &#x1D45B; colors, how many &#x1D458;-color combinations can we make?
