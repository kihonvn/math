# The Additive Principle 

## Theorems

### The additive principle

If event &#x1D434; can occur in &#x1D45A; ways, and event &#x1D435; can occur in &#x1D45B; **disjoint** ways, then the event "&#x1D434; or &#x1D435;" can occur in &#x1D45A; + &#x1D45B; ways.

### The extension of the additive principle

If events &#x1D434;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>, &#x1D434;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>, ..., and &#x1D434;<sub>&#x1D45B;</sub> can occur in &#x1D45A; disjoint ways, then the event "&#x1D434;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>, &#x1D434;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>, ..., or &#x1D434;<sub>&#x1D45B;</sub>" can occur in  ways.
