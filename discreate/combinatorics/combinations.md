# Combinations

Order is not important in combinations.

## Definitions

### Binomial coefficient

Let &#x1D45B; and &#x1D458; be non-negative integers. The binomial coefficient of &#x1D45B; and &#x1D458;, &#x1D436;(&#x1D45B;, &#x1D458;), is the number of combinations of &#x1D45B; objects taken &#x1D458; at a time, and is read "&#x1D45B; choose &#x1D458;".

## Theorems

### Binomial coefficient formula

&#x1D436;(&#x1D45B;, &#x1D458;) = &#x1D45B;! / ((&#x1D45B; - &#x1D458;)! * &#x1D458;!)

## Practices

1. If we toss a fair coin five times, how many cases do we get three heads?
