## Propositions

A proposition is a sentence having a definite truth value (i.e., we can say it is true or false).

## Truth tables

A truth table is a table where each column contains possible truth values of a proposition. In a truth table, &#x1D7F6; and &#x1D7F7; represent &#x1D461;&#x1D45F;&#x1D462;&#x1D452; and &#x1D453;&#x1D44E;&#x1D459;&#x1D460;&#x1D452;, respectively.

## Practices

1. Determine the truth value of the following propositions:
   - If an integer is not even, then it is not a multiple of four.
   - The fact that a polygon is a rectangle is a necessary condition that it is a square.
   - If &#x1D465;<sup>&#x1D7F8;</sup> is not &#x1D7F8;&#x1D7FB;, then &#x1D465; is not &#x1D7FB;.
   - If &#x1D465; = &#x1D7F8; or &#x1D465; = &#x1D7F9;, then &#x1D465;<sup>&#x1D7F8;</sup> - &#x1D7FB;&#x1D465; + &#x1D7FC; = 0
   - &#x1D465; = &#x1D466; is a necessary condition for &#x1D465;<sup>&#x1D7F8;</sup> = &#x1D466;<sup>&#x1D7F8;</sup>
