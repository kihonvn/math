# Conditional Statement

The conditional statement, "If &#x1D45D; then &#x1D45E;", denoted &#x1D45D; &#x2192; &#x1D45E;, is defined by the following truth table:

|&#x1D45D;|&#x1D45E;|&#x1D45D; &#x2192; &#x1D45E;
|:-:|:-:|:-:
|&#x1D7F6;|&#x1D7F6;|&#x1D7F7;
|&#x1D7F6;|&#x1D7F7;|&#x1D7F7;
|&#x1D7F7;|&#x1D7F6;|&#x1D7F6;
|&#x1D7F7;|&#x1D7F7;|&#x1D7F7;

We also say:
- &#x1D45D; implies &#x1D45E;.
- &#x1D45E; follows from &#x1D45D;.
- &#x1D45E;, if &#x1D45E;.
- &#x1D45D;, only if &#x1D45E;.
- &#x1D45D; is sufficient for &#x1D45E;.
- &#x1D45E; is necessary for &#x1D45D;.

The conditional statement of propositions is false if the necessary condition is true and the sufficient condition is false.
