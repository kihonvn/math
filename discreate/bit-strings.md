# Bit Strings

## Definitions

A bit string is a sequence of bits. We present a bit by either 洧링 or 洧맀 characters to indicate true or false, yes or no, exist or not exist, etc. The number of 洧링s in a bit string is called its weight, which is always less than or equal to its length, the number of its bits. For example, 洧맀洧맀, 洧맀洧링, 洧링洧맀, and 洧링洧링 are 2-bit bit strings whose weight is 洧맀, 洧링, 洧링, and 洧맂, respectively.

## Analysis

### Interested in length only

Let &#x1D459; be the length of a bit string, i.e., we have &#x1D459; places to put in either &#x1D7F6; or &#x1D7F7;. Thus, we have &#x1D7F8;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> * &#x1D7F8;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> * ... * &#x1D7F8;<sub>&#x1D459;-&#x1D7F7;</sub> * &#x1D7F8;<sub>&#x1D459;</sub> = &#x1D7F8;<sup>&#x1D459;</sup> ways to construct a &#x1D459;-length bit string.

### Interested in both length and weight

Let a bit string has &#x1D459; length and &#x1D464; weight, i.e., we have &#x1D459; places to put in &#x1D464; &#x1D7F7;s and (&#x1D459;-&#x1D464;) &#x1D7F6;s.

If we put &#x1D7F7; at the first place, the problem becomes to find how many ways to put &#x1D464;-&#x1D7F7; &#x1D7F7;s and (&#x1D459;-&#x1D464;) &#x1D7F6;s in &#x1D459;-&#x1D7F7; places, i.e., a bit string &#x1D459;-&#x1D7F7; and &#x1D464;-&#x1D7F7; weight. On the other hand, we would put &#x1D7F6; at the first place, we need to find have many ways to construct a bit string &#x1D459;-&#x1D7F7; length and &#x1D464; weight.
