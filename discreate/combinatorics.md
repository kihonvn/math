An art of quickly couting the number of objects in a set.

## Theorems

### The rule of products

If &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> and &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> are the number of ways to perform &#x1D45C;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> and &#x1D45C;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> operations, then there are &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>&#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> ways to perform &#x1D45C;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> and &#x1D45C;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>. Note that &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> and &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> must be independent.

### Extended rule of products

If &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>, &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>, ..., and &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D45B;</sub> ways to perform each in &#x1D45B; operations, then there are &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>&#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>...&#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D45B;</sub> ways to accomplish &#x1D45B; operations.
