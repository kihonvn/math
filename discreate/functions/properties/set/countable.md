# Countable Sets

## Definition

If a set is finite or has the [same cardinality](same-cardinality.md#definition) as the set of positive integers, it is called a countable set.

## Theorems

- &#x211A; is countable (countably infinite).
- &#x211D; is uncountable.

## Practices

1. Is &#x2115; countable?
1. Is &#x2124; countable?
1. Prove that the set of odd integers is countable.
1. Prove that the set &#x2115; &#x00D7; &#x2115; is countable.

## Answers

1. Yes, it is. &#x1D453; : &#x2115; &#x2192; &#x2119; defined by &#x1D465; + &#x1D7F7; is bijective.
1. Yes, it is. &#x1D453; : &#x2115; &#x2192; &#x2124; defined by &#x1D465;/&#x1D7F8; if &#x1D465; is even and -(&#x1D465; + &#x1D7F7;)/&#x1D7F8; if &#x1D465; is odd is bijective.
1. Let &#x1D44B; be the set of odd integers. &#x1D453; : &#x1D44B; &#x2192; &#x2124; defined by (&#x1D465; - &#x1D7F7;)/&#x1D7F8; is bijective.
