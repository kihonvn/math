# Bijective Functions - Bijection

## Definition

A function &#x1D453; : &#x1D44B; &#x2192; &#x1D44C; is bijective if it is both [injective](injective.md#definition) and [surjective](surjective.md#definition).

### Examples

- If &#x1D44B; = {&#x1D7F7;, &#x1D7F8;}, &#x1D44C; = {&#x1D7F9;, &#x1D7FA;}, and &#x1D453; : &#x1D44B; &#x2192; &#x1D44C; = {(&#x1D7F7;, &#x1D7F9;), (&#x1D7F8;, &#x1D7FA;)}, then &#x1D453; is bijective.
- If &#x1D44B; = {&#x1D7F7;, &#x1D7F8;}, &#x1D44C; = {&#x1D7F9;}, and &#x1D453; : &#x1D44B; &#x2192; &#x1D44C; = {(&#x1D7F7;, &#x1D7F9;), (&#x1D7F8;, &#x1D7F9;)}, then &#x1D453; is not bijective (surjective but not injective).
- If &#x1D44B; = {&#x1D7F7;, &#x1D7F8;}, &#x1D44C; = {&#x1D7F9;, &#x1D7FA;, &#x1D7FB;}, and &#x1D453; : &#x1D44B; &#x2192; &#x1D44C; = {(&#x1D7F7;, &#x1D7F9;), (&#x1D7F8;, &#x1D7FA;)}, then &#x1D453; is not bijective (injective but not surjective).
