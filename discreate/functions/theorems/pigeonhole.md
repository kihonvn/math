# The Pigeonhole Principle

## Theorem

Let &#x1D453; : &#x1D44B; &#x2192; &#x1D44C;. If &#x1D45B; &#x2265; &#x1D7F7; and &#x2758;&#x1D44B;&#x2758; > &#x1D45B;&#x2758;&#x1D44C;&#x2758;, then there exists an &#x1D44C;  element that is the image under &#x1D453; of at least &#x1D45B; + &#x1D7F7; X elements.
