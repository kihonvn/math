# Equivalent Relations

## Definition

A relation r on a set A is equivelent if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

### Examples

#### Equivelent Fractions

An equivalent fraction is a relation r on Z × Z<sup>+</sup> such that x<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub> = y<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> where (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) ∈ r.

#### Congruence Modulo n

The congruence modulo n a ≡<sub>n</sub> b is an equivalence relation on Z defined by a - b = nk where a, b, n, k ∈ Z and n ≥ 2.

#### r on A = {lines in a plane} defined by a // b
