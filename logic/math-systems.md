# Mathematical Systems

## Definition

### Mathematical system

A mathematical system consists of:
- A set or universe, &#x1D448;
- Definitions: sentences that explain the meaning of concepts that relate to the universe. Any term used in describing the universe itself is said to be undefined. All definitions are given in terms of these undefined concepts of objects.
- Axioms: assertions about the properties of the universe and rules for creating and justifying more assertions.

### Theorem

A theorem is a true proposition derived from the axioms of a [mathematical system](#mathematical-system).

We often express a theorem as the *premises*, a finite number of propositions, &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>, &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>, ..., &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D45B;</sub>, imply &#x1D436;, the *conclusion* proposition.

For example, &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> &#x2227; &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> &#x2227; ... &#x2227; &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D45B;</sub> &#x21D2; &#x1D436;

### Proof

A proof of a [theorem](#theorem) is a finite sequence of logically valid steps demonstrating the premises of the theorem imply the conclusion.
