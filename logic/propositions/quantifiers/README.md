# Quantified Propositions Over A Set

There are propositions we can only determine their truth value in a particular context or conditions as if they have one or more blanks for us to fill appropriate values in, where each blank only accepts items having similar characteristics or in a group. With a proposition p containing one blank, each filled-in item can cause p to have a different truth value. Since we are often interested in those that make the value of p true, we group them into a set T<sub>p</sub>, called the truth set of p. Moreover, we are also interested in its size, especially in the two cases, not empty and containing all possibly filled-in items, which are two popular quantifiers, existential, the former, and universal, the latter.
