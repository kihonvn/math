# The Multiplicative Principle

Aka Rule of product

## Theorems

### The multiplicative principle or the rule of products

If event &#x1D434; can occur in &#x1D45A; ways, and event &#x1D435; can occur in &#x1D45B; disjoint ways, then the event "&#x1D434; and &#x1D435;" can occur in &#x1D45A; * &#x1D45B; ways.

Or

If &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> and &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> are the number of ways to perform &#x1D45C;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> and &#x1D45C;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> operations, then there are &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>&#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> ways to perform &#x1D45C;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> and &#x1D45C;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>. Note that &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub> and &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub> must be independent.

### The extension of the multiplicative principle or the extended rule of products

If &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>, &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>, ..., and &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D45B;</sub> ways to perform each in &#x1D45B; operations, then there are &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>&#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>...&#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D45B;</sub> ways to accomplish &#x1D45B; operations. Note that &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F7;</sub>, &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D7F8;</sub>, ..., and &#x1D45D;<sub>&#x1D45B;</sub> must be independent.

## Practices

1. You have three regular ties and five bow ties. If you wear both types, how many options do you have?
