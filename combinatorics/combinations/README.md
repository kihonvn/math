# Combinations

Order is not important in combinations.

## Definitions

### Binomial coefficient

Let &#x1D45B; and &#x1D458; be non-negative integers. The binomial coefficient of &#x1D45B; and &#x1D458;, &#x1D436;(&#x1D45B;, &#x1D458;), is ***the number of combinations*** of &#x1D45B; objects taken &#x1D458; at a time, and is read "***&#x1D45B; choose &#x1D458;***".

## Theorems

### Binomial coefficient formula

Let &#x1D45B; and &#x1D458; be non-negative integers and &#x1D458; <= &#x1D45B;.

&#x1D436;(&#x1D45B;, &#x1D458;) = &#x1D45B;! / ((&#x1D45B; - &#x1D458;)! * &#x1D458;!)

### Binomial theorem

*Binomial theorem gives us a formula for expanding (&#x1D465;+&#x1D466;)<sup>&#x1D45B;</sup>, &#x1D45B; &#x2208; &#x2115; and &#x1D465;, &#x1D466; &#x2208; &#x211D;.*

Let &#x1D45B; be non-negative integer.

(&#x1D465; + &#x1D466;)<sup>&#x1D45B;</sup> = &#x2211;<sub>&#x1D458; in &#x1D7F6;, &#x1D45B;</sub> &#x1D436;(&#x1D45B; &#x1D458;) &#x1D465;<sup>&#x1D45B; - &#x1D458;</sup>&#x1D466;<sup>&#x1D458;</sup>
