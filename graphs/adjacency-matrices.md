# Adjacency Matrices

## Definition

An adjacency matrix is a representation of a graph in a table form containing rows and columns for each vertex. If there is an edge connecting two vertices x and y, the adjacency matrix will have 1 at the cell x-th row and y-th column, and 0, otherwise.

G = (V, E) as c<sub>xy</sub> = {1 if {x, y} in E, 0 otherwise}
