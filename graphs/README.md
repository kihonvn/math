# Graphs

## Definition

A graph is an ordered pair G = (V, E) consisitng of a nonempty set V (called the vertices) and a set E (called the edges) of two-element subsets of V.

A graph is a structure consisting of a nonempty vertices set V and an edges set E. Each edge e in E, denoted {x, y}, is the connection between two vertices x and y in V, called adjacent endpoints.

### Examples

- G = ({a}, {})
- G = ({a, b}, {{a, b}})
- G = ({a, b, c}, {{a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}})
