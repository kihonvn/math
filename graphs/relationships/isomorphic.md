# Isomorphic Graphs

## Definitions

### An isomorphism of two graphs



### Isomorphic graphs

Two graphs are isomorphic if and only if they have an isomorphism.

## Practices

1. Is it possible for two non-isomorphic graphs to have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges? What if the degrees of the vertices in the two graphs are the same?
